<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>East Groningen is a shrinking region, the population is decreasing but the amount of elderly people is increasing. These elderly people are generally less informed about public transport. Their knowledge usually doesn’t go much further than their daily drive to the supermarket. Hereby they have less interest in public transport. Their priorities are different; they have other wishes concerning public transport. Where as a student takes the bus to go to school, elderly people take the bus to go shopping. However, the information provided towards this target audience could be a lot better. When the target audience receives better information about public transport, the use of public transport will increase. </p>
<p>For the target audience (Which is further described in the chapter: target audience analyses) there will have to come an informative application. The target audience that will use this application doesn’t have a lot of experience using new technologies like tablets, smart phones let alone applications for these devices. Therefore the usability for the target audience will be really important. The application needs to give out instructions and the basic layout will have to be intelligible within one quick look.
    The secondary target audience of this application will be the employees of the WMO-counter. They will be the ones to eventually give out advice to the primary target audience.
</p>
<p>
    For the users of public transport in the region East Groningen it is important to know what nodes are connected to certain cities. In general it isn’t clear what the possibilities are outside of the usual short rides. Also there isn’t always a decent connection between for example a distant residential area and a public transport node. More information about the possibilities of different directions and destinations from nodes and certain stops will be needed.
</p>
<p>
    The assignment for this target audience is developing an information system (Either an application or a website), that will provide the target audience with information concerning the possibilities of public transport and nodes in their region. When the target audience has a better understanding of public transport thanks to well provided information it will affect the use of public transport. Public transport will be more commonly used by the target audience and increase their mobility. The main goal is to lower the threshold for the use of public transport by the target audience.

<h1>
    Functionality
</h1>
<p>
    The application needs to contain a couple of functionalities. It will primarily be about providing information. Providing good information so the target audience knows how to use the application with ease. This means there needs to be a lot of work put into the usability and the user friendliness of the application. It is of great importance that the user will not encounter any problems using the application. The design has to be basic en the explanations provided will have to be concise and understandable. The chapter usability and user friendliness will go into further detail about this subject.
</p>
<h1>
    Public transport
</h1>
<p>
    The application will have to show the public transport nodes in the region clearly. The application will also have to display different routes and times. The target audience usually knows about shorter rides, but misses out on information about rides further away from home. The travel options will have to be displayed when the user wants to see them. The facilities at every stop will have to be shown so it’s the user knows for example if there is a bench to sit on at the stop. The big difference with an application like 929ov is the target audience. This application really aims at elderly people while 9292ov is aimed at a bigger audience. The application will be designed specifically for elderly people and won’t be the same as 9292ov.
</p>
<h1>
    Marketplace
</h1>
<p>
    What will make the application innovative is the marketplace component. The application will contain a marketplace section which will contain the offering of rides by individuals. These rides can be offered but also claimed by users. Users can this way travel with someone from one point to another or even better, from their home to a node in their area so they can continue their travel by public transport. For this particular part of the application it needs to be really easy to offer and claim a ride, simple options and just like the entire application the design has to be easy to understand. Especially the part that covers the starting point of a ride and the destination of the ride needs to be clear to the user.
</p>
<h1>
    Facilities
</h1>
<p>
    There will have to be an option where the target audience can see the available facilities at stops. Facilities like, benches, wheelchair accessibility a toilet or a blind led strip. This part of the application will be supported by an existing site; haltescan.nl.
</p>
<h1>
    System
</h1>
<p>
    The system the application will be built on is currently in development by the WP4 team. They are working on the backbone for the development of other application. Because this system isn’t finished yet we will have to focus on the front-end part of the application. The usability and user friendliness will be the main point of attention. The front-end will be built so that it will be easy linkable to the backbone.
